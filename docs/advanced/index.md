# Advanced Usage

In this section, we will explore some advanced use cases.

- [Customize Client Settings](client-settings.md): You can run clients with custom CLI parameters, and/or 
multiple variations of the clients.
- [Large Simulations](large-sims.md): We have tested simulations with up to 1000 nodes! You need to configure
your system to support this.
- [Capture Metrics](metrics.md): You can run Prometheus within the simulation to capture the metrics offered
by the clients. (Currently Lighthouse only)
- [Custom Hosts](custom-hosts.md): If you need to add processes that are not natively supported by `ethshadow` 
to the simulation, you can use Shadow's host configuration instead.
